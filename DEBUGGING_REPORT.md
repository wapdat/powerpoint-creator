# PowerPoint Creator - Debugging Investigation Report

**Generated**: 2025-08-08 06:37 UTC

## Issue Summary

User reported that PowerPoint files were not changing despite code modifications, with symptoms:
1. Files still need repair when opening
2. Layout looks exactly the same every time  
3. Seems to generate the same output regardless of changes

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Outdated Global CLI Installation

The main problem was that the globally installed CLI command was not using the updated local `dist/` folder. The investigation revealed:

1. **Global CLI Location**: `/Users/lindsaysmith/.npm-global/bin/powerpoint-creator`
2. **Symlink Target**: `../lib/node_modules/powerpoint-creator/dist/cli.js`
3. **Issue**: The globally installed version was from a previous `npm install -g` and wasn't automatically updated when local changes were made

### Verification Process

#### Test 1: Build Process Verification
- ✅ `npm run build` was properly updating the `dist/` folder
- ✅ TypeScript compilation was working correctly
- ✅ Source file timestamps showed recent modifications

#### Test 2: Direct vs Global CLI Comparison
- ✅ Running `node dist/cli.js` directly produced expected results
- ❌ Running `powerpoint-creator` (global command) was using outdated code
- ❌ Permission issues occurred with the global symlink

#### Test 3: Change Detection Test
Added debug modifications to verify code changes were applied:
```typescript
// Added bright green background and red text with [DEBUG] prefix
slide.background = { color: '00FF00' }; // BRIGHT GREEN DEBUG BACKGROUND
slide.addText('[DEBUG] ' + slideData.title, {
  color: 'FF0000', // BRIGHT RED TEXT
  // ... other options
});
```

**Results**:
- Files generated with `node dist/cli.js` contained debug changes
- Binary file comparison showed files were different
- XML content extraction confirmed debug text and colors were present

#### Test 4: Timestamp Verification
Added timestamp to subtitle to prove each generation creates unique content:
```typescript
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
slide.addText(slideData.subtitle + ` (Generated: ${timestamp})`, {
```

**Results**:
- File 1: `Generated: 2025-08-08T05:37:30.281Z`
- File 2: `Generated: 2025-08-08T05:37:36.088Z`
- Binary comparison confirmed files were different
- Proved that code changes ARE being applied

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Global CLI Installation
```bash
npm link  # Properly links local development version to global command
```

### 2. Verification Commands
```bash
# Check if global CLI points to correct location
which powerpoint-creator
readlink /Users/lindsaysmith/.npm-global/bin/powerpoint-creator

# Test that changes are applied
node dist/cli.js -i test.json -o output.pptx
```

## File Structure Analysis

### Build Process Working Correctly
- `src/` → TypeScript source files (modified August 7-8)
- `npm run build` → `dist/` compiled JavaScript files
- Build process includes `npm run clean` → `tsc` compilation
- All timestamps confirmed fresh compilation

### CLI Execution Flow
1. Global command: `powerpoint-creator` → symlink → `dist/cli.js`
2. Direct execution: `node dist/cli.js` (always uses latest)
3. Package.json bin configuration: `"powerpoint-creator": "./dist/cli.js"`

## File Repair Issue Investigation

The "files need repair" issue may be unrelated to our change detection problem. Potential causes:
1. PowerPoint version compatibility issues
2. PptxGenJS library generating slightly non-standard XML
3. File corruption during generation (less likely given our tests)

### Recommended Next Steps for Repair Issue
1. Test with different PowerPoint versions
2. Compare generated XML with working PowerPoint files
3. Check PptxGenJS configuration options
4. Validate against Office Open XML standards

## Conclusions

✅ **Code changes ARE working** - Proven with debug modifications and timestamps  
✅ **Files ARE different each time** - Binary comparison and content analysis confirm  
✅ **Build process is correct** - TypeScript compilation working properly  
✅ **Issue was global CLI installation** - Fixed with `npm link`  

The user's original problem was caused by an outdated global installation, not by the code changes failing to apply. The development workflow should now work correctly.

## Development Workflow

For future development:
1. Make changes to `src/` files
2. Run `npm run build` to compile
3. Test with `node dist/cli.js` or use global `powerpoint-creator` command
4. Use `npm link` after major changes to ensure global command is updated

## Test Files Generated

- `test-minimal.json` - Simple test case
- `test-debug.pptx` - First test file (before npm link fix)
- `test-debug-2.pptx` - With debug changes applied
- `test-global.pptx` - Using global command after fix
- `test-timestamp-1.pptx` - Timestamp verification file 1
- `test-timestamp-2.pptx` - Timestamp verification file 2

All test files confirmed that code changes are properly applied and files are unique.
