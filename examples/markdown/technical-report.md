## System Architecture

### Microservices Overview

Our system now consists of 12 independent microservices:

1. **User Service** - Authentication and user management
2. **Product Service** - Product catalog and inventory
3. **Order Service** - Order processing and fulfillment
4. **Payment Service** - Payment processing and billing
5. **Notification Service** - Email and push notifications
6. **Analytics Service** - Real-time analytics and reporting

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Frontend | React 18 | User interface |
| API Gateway | Kong | Request routing |
| Backend | Node.js | Service implementation |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Primary data store |
| Cache | Redis | Performance optimization |
| Queue | RabbitMQ | Async processing |
| Container | Docker | Deployment |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes | Container management |

## Infrastructure Scaling

### Resource Utilization

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| CPU Usage | 65% | 70% | ✅ Optimal |
| Memory Usage | 72% | 80% | ✅ Good |
| Disk I/O | 45% | 60% | ✅ Excellent |
| Network Bandwidth | 55% | 70% | ✅ Good |

### Auto-scaling Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: api-hpa
spec:
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 20
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70
```

## Security Improvements

### Vulnerability Assessment

- Conducted quarterly security audit
- Resolved 15 critical vulnerabilities
- Implemented WAF rules
- Enhanced encryption protocols

### Compliance Status

1. **GDPR** - Fully compliant
2. **SOC 2** - Audit completed
3. **ISO 27001** - In progress
4. **PCI DSS** - Level 1 certified

## Database Optimization

### Query Performance

Top 5 optimized queries showed significant improvements:

| Query | Before (ms) | After (ms) | Improvement |
|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| User lookup | 120 | 15 | 87.5% |
| Product search | 250 | 45 | 82% |
| Order history | 180 | 30 | 83.3% |
| Analytics aggregation | 500 | 75 | 85% |
| Inventory check | 90 | 12 | 86.7% |

### Index Strategy

```sql
-- New composite indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_status ON users(email, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_date ON orders(user_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_price ON products(category_id, price);
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection

- **Prometheus** - Time-series metrics
- **Grafana** - Visualization dashboards
- **ELK Stack** - Log aggregation
- **Jaeger** - Distributed tracing

### Alert Configuration

| Alert Type | Threshold | Response Time |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| High CPU | > 80% | < 2 min |
| Memory Leak | > 90% | < 5 min |
| Error Rate | > 1% | < 1 min |
| Latency | > 500ms | < 3 min |
